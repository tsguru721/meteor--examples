### I'm having an issue:
  - Give an expressive description of what is went wrong
  - Version of `ostrio:logger` you're experiencing this issue
  - Version of `Meteor` you're experiencing this issue
  - Is it *Server* or *Client* (*Browser*) issue?
  - Browser name and its version (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)?
  - Platform name and its version (Win, Mac, Linux)?
  - If you're getting an error or exception, please provide its full stack-trace as plain-text or screenshot

### I have a suggestion:
  - Describe your feature / request
  - How you going to use it? Give a usage example(s)

### Documentation is missing something or incorrect (have typos, etc.):
  - Give an expressive description what you have changed/added and why
  - Make sure you're using correct markdown markup
  - Make sure all code blocks starts with tripple ``` (*backtick*) and have a syntax tag, for more read [this docs](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/#syntax-highlighting)
  - Post your addition/changes in issue, we will manage it

## Thank you, and do not forget to get rid of this default message
